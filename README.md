# .NET

My goal with this repo is to build a comprehensive set of examples covering C# language and .NET base class library fundamentals.

This repo contains two .net core projects:

* A small command line application.
* A set of unit tests which demonstrate core language and base class library usage.



## Running the code

Running the command line app:


```shell
$ dotnet run --project src/app/app.csproj
```

Running the unit tests:

```shell
$ dotnet test
```
